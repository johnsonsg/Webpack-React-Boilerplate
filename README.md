# Webpack-React-Boilerplate

Setting Up Webpack with React and CI/CD with AWS

## What we are using

- Yarn
- Babel
- Webpack

## Ref

- webpack.js.org/configuration

## Notes

- AWS Codebuild only supports 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, currently. So when setting up pipeline make sure you support one of these versions.
- Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/runtime-versions.html
- So make sure you are using a Node Version Manager to set your node to either of the list above when using your project, or install in buildspec and make sure your app works with this version.
- CI/CD successfully complete.
