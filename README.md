# Webpack-React-Boilerplate
Setting Up Webpack with React

## What we are using
* Yarn
* Babel
* Webpack
## Ref
* webpack.js.org/configuration

## Notes
* AWS Codebuild only supports 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, currently. So when setting up pipeline make sure you support one of these versions.
* Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/runtime-versions.html
* So make sure you are using a Node Version Manager to set your node to either of the list above when using your project, or install in buildspec and make sure your app works with this version.
* CI/CD successfully complete.
